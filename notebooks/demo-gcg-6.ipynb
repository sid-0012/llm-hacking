      "38.2079: Course Overview: This course is on graduate-level computer security, focusing on the software systems foundations of building secure computer systems. We will read a mix of classic and new papers in the field and will cover a range of topics from trusted computing, operating systems, web/cloud systems, and machine learning. Our goal is to illustrate research challenges and solutions. It is not designed to be a tutorial course, but rather to give students the context to understand current security research and evaluate their interest in the field. The course will examine both the defensive and offensive side of the field. At the conclusion of the course, the students will have the foundation to conduct research in computer security and to apply the latest security research to a particular area of practice.\n",

It is unlike other courses you've encountered in your career where there are a fixed set of topics with exams and specific skills to learn. Rather, we will be reading papers and discussing/analyzing those papers. Your primary performance will be based on your ability to formulate and tackle research problems in computer security.
